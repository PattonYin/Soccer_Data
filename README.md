# Thoughts about a new ML model basing on existing data - Outcome Prediction

## 1. After_game_Prediction

Using the Statistics of the players / teams in the whole match to predict the outcome of the game.

### IO:

Input: Team Statistics
Output: Outcome

### Methods:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest

### How to do this:

1. Scrape the websites
2. Built Decision Tree / Randome Forest Models

## 2. In_game_Prediction

How about using the performance of the players in the first 65 minutes to predict the outcome of the game?

```
input:

```

```
output:
outcome of the game
```
